Contradictions:
 - If you think its a Copy of XL then its partially true
 - I've took part on making of XL and Ricolino ROMs for Mido which are Released on July 16, 2021 and July 19, 2021
 - At that time, XL and Ricolino ROMs were builded by Rambo (@Rambo203) and got released on IndieMIUI
 - I've permissions from both the Developer and from IndieMIUI
 - As per XDA OpenGPL, I've already credits to both Developer and the XL Labs too
 - As per Github Community Guidelines, if I worked on someone project then I can use some parts of it
 - From my point of view, I don't see any point to take permissions from current rom maintainer who is almost Ded AF
 - I think that's enough to clear all the contradictions
